# 📁 Thread and Multithreading Course Project

Welcome to my Thread and Multithreading course project repository! I developed this project to enhance my knowledge and skills in the realm of multithreading while I was enrolled in a highly reputable and renowned online learning platform in Brazil, Alura.

## 📚 Course Overview

During this course, I delved deep into the intricacies of multithreading and related concepts. I learned how to leverage threads and synchronized methods effectively to improve application performance and responsiveness. This course provided me with valuable insights into optimizing software performance through parallel processing.

## 🌟 About Me

I embarked on this project as part of my ongoing journey to expand my expertise in software development. While interning at STI - Information Technology Solutions, I had the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills I gained from this course to accelerate query operations, generate reports, and create a user-friendly dashboard with progress indicators on the system's main screen. These enhancements led to a significant performance boost, making data retrieval up to 66% faster without the need for major structural changes.
